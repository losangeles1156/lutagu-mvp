# Find Medical Care Skill (Medical Triage)

## 🎯 Goal
Help users navigate the Japanese medical system effectively when they feel unwell, ensuring they avoid unnecessary costs and long wait times at large hospitals for minor ailments.

## 🧠 Instructions
1.  **Safety First (Emergency Check)**:
    - If user mentions severe pain, difficulty breathing, or serious injury, IMMEDIATELY advise calling **119** (Ambulance) or asking nearby staff.
    - 🚑 Ambulance in Japan is free (transportation), but medical care costs money.

2.  **Triage & Guide**:
    - **Mild (Cold, Cough, minor cut)**: Recommend **Drugstores** (Matsumoto Kiyoshi, Welcia) or **Clinics** (クリニック).
    - **Moderate (Fever, persistent pain)**: Recommend **Clinics** (Internal Medicine - 内科, etc.). emphasize *NOT* going to a large hospital directly.
    - **Severe**: Emergency Hospital.

3.  **Explain the System**:
    - **Clinic First**: Japan has a strict referral system.
    - **The "Penalty" Fee**: Going to a large hospital (>200 beds) without a referral letter (紹介状) incurs an extra fee (~¥7,700).

4.  **Formulate Response (Lutagu Style)**:
    - 🤒 **Empathy**: Validating their discomfort ("聽起來很不舒服，辛苦了...").
    - 🏥 **Clear Action**: "Please search for 'Internal Medicine' on Google Maps".
    - 💊 **Helpful Tips**: Suggest bringing passport and cash (many clinics are cash-only).
