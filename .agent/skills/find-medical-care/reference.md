# Japanese Medical System Reference

## 1. Facility Types (Where to go?)
| Type | Japanese | Purpose | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clinic** | 診療所 / クリニック | **First Choice**. Colds, flu, stomach ache, minor injuries. | Shorter wait times. Doctor provides specific care. |
| **General Hospital** | 総合病院 / 大学病院 | **Referral Only**. Surgery, specialized tests, hospitalization. | **Long wait times**. Requires referral letter. |
| **Pharmacy** | 薬局 / ドラッグストア | Mild symptoms. OTC meds. | Pharmacists can advise on cold meds. |

## 2. The "Referral System" Cost (Critical!)
- **Rule**: If you visit a large hospital (`>200 beds`) **without a referral letter (紹介状)** from a clinic, you must pay an extra **"Sentei Ryoyohi" (Selected Medical Care Coverage Expenses)**.
- **Cost**: typically **¥7,700** or more (up to ¥11,000 at university hospitals), ON TOP of the medical consultation fee.
- **Advice**: "Always go to a Clinic (クリニック) first unless it's an emergency."

## 3. Useful Medical Departments (Kanji)
- **Cold/Fever**: `内科` (Naika / Internal Medicine)
- **Injury/Bone**: `整形外科` (Seikei Geka / Orthopedics)
- **Skin rash**: `皮膚科` (Hifuka / Dermatology)
- **Child**: `小児科` (Shonika / Pediatrics)
- **Toothache**: `歯科` (Shika / Dentistry)

## 4. Payment & Insurance
- **Travel Insurance**: Most clinics **cannot** cashless claim directly. You must pay upfront (100%) and claim later.
- **Credit Cards**: Many small clinics are **CASH ONLY**. Bring at least ¥10,000-¥20,000 cash.

## 5. Emergency
- **Ambulance**: Dial `119`. Say "Medical" or "Kyukyu".
