# Akihabara Station Riding Knowledge

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Akihabara（秋葉原）

### Traps
- [Trap] 🚪 **Electric Town Exit Confusion**: The station has multiple exits (Electric Town, Central, Showa-dori). Electric Town Exit leads to the main electronics district, but it's often overcrowded. (Advice: ⚠️ Use Showa-dori Exit for less crowded access to the same area)
- [Trap] 🚃 **Transfer Distance**: Transferring between JR lines and Tsukuba Express requires exiting the paid area and walking through the streets. It's not a simple indoor transfer. (Advice: 💡 Allow at least 10 minutes for this transfer)
- [Trap] 🎮 **Weekend Crowds**: On weekends and holidays, the narrow streets around Electric Town Exit become extremely congested with tourists and cosplayers. (Advice: ⚠️ Visit on weekdays if possible, or arrive before 11am)

### Hacks
- [Hack] 🛒 **Tax-Free Shopping Hub**: Most electronics stores (Yodobashi, BicCamera, Sofmap) offer tax-free shopping for tourists with passport. Look for "TAX FREE" signs and bring your passport.
- [Hack] 🍜 **Ramen Street Underground**: The Akihabara UDX building basement has a "ramen street" with multiple famous shops, less crowded than surface restaurants.
- [Hack] 🎌 **Anime District Navigation**: The main anime/manga shops are clustered on Chuo-dori (closed to cars on Sundays). Start from Animate, then explore Radio Kaikan for figures.
- [Hack] 💱 **Best Currency Exchange**: The Daikokuya shop near Electric Town Exit offers competitive currency exchange rates, better than most airport counters.

## odpt:Station:TokyoMetro.Hibiya.Akihabara（日比谷線秋葉原）

### Traps
- [Trap] 🚇 **Deep Platform**: The Hibiya Line platform is quite deep underground. It takes about 3-4 minutes just to reach street level via escalators. (Advice: 💡 Factor this into your travel time)
- [Trap] 🔀 **Not Connected to JR**: Despite being named "Akihabara", the Hibiya Line station is NOT directly connected to JR Akihabara inside. You must exit and walk. (Advice: ⚠️ Use Exit 3 for shortest walk to JR)

### Hacks
- [Hack] 🚶 **Secret Shortcut**: Exit 5 leads directly to the Akihabara UDX building, avoiding the crowded streets.
- [Hack] 📱 **Quieter Access**: Use this station instead of JR if you want to avoid weekend crowds. It's less known to tourists.
