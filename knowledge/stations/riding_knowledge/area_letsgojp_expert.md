# LetsGoJP Expert Knowledge Ingestion (Final Aggregation)

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Shinjuku（新宿站）
### Traps
- [Trap] 🚶 **Kabukicho Orientation**: Heading to Kabukicho via the "West Exit" is a major detour. (Advice: ⚠️ Use **"East Exit"** or **"Central East Exit"** for direct access).
- [Trap] 🚃 **Exit Complexity**: Using the wrong grouping (East, West, South) can add 15 minutes of walking. (Advice: 💡 Follow yellow signs; they group exits by direction).
- [Trap] 🔀 **Keio New Line Trap**: "Keio Line" and "Keio New Line" have different ticket gates. (Advice: ⚠️ Check your ticket/train; "Keio New Line" leads to Toei Shinjuku Line).

### Hacks
- [Hack] 🚌 **Direct Airport Bus**: "Tokyu Kabukicho Tower" has direct buses to Haneda (~55m) and Narita (~90m), avoiding the station maze.
- [Hack] 🚆 **Seibu Shinjuku Shortcut**: For core Kabukicho, Seibu Shinjuku Station is a 1-3 minute walk, much closer than the JR side.
- [Hack] 🍺 **Izakaya Streets**: "Memory Lane" (Omoide Yokocho) for old Tokyo vibes, "Golden Gai" for tiny themed bars.

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Shibuya（澀谷站）
### Traps
- [Trap] 🏗️ **Re-development Maze**: Construction makes old maps obsolete. (Advice: 💡 Look for signs to "Shibuya Sakura Stage" (2024) and "Scramble Square").
- [Trap] 🐕 **Hachiko Meeting Trap**: The Hachiko statue is too crowded to find people. (Advice: 💡 Meet at the **"Moyai Statue"** at the South Exit).

### Hacks

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Ikebukuro（池袋站）
### Traps
- [Trap] 🔀 **Exit Overload**: 8 lines and 50+ exits. (Advice: 💡 Key groups: **East Exit** for Sunshine City/Seibu, **West Exit** for Tobu/Restaurants).
- [Trap] 🚶 **Sunshine City Distance**: It's a long walk from the gates. (Advice: 💡 Use the underground passage during rain or heat).

### Hacks

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Tokyo（東京站）
### Traps
- [Trap] ↔️ **Side Confusion**: "Marunouchi" (Imperial Palace side) vs "Yaesu" (Bus/Shopping side). (Advice: 💡 Use the **"North Free Passage"** (北自由通路) to cross sides without a ticket).
- [Trap] ↕️ **Vertical Logic**: Shinkansen is above ground; Sobu/Keiyo lines are deep underground. (Advice: 💡 Factor in 10-15 minutes for Keiyo Line transfers).

### Hacks

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Ueno（上野站）
### Traps

## odpt:Station:JR-East.Akihabara（秋葉原站）
### Traps

### Hacks
- [Hack] ↔️ **東西自由通路**: Use the "East-West Free Passage" near the Central Gate to cross the station without a ticket.

## odpt:Station:Toei.Asakusa（淺草站）
### Traps
- [Trap] 🔠 **Station Mismatch**: "Tsukuba Express Asakusa" is 10 minutes away from "Metro Asakusa".
- [Trap] ♿ **Elevator Shortage**: 14 exits but only **2 elevators**. (Advice: 💡 Check the map specifically for Exit A2b or similar for heavy luggage).

### Hacks
