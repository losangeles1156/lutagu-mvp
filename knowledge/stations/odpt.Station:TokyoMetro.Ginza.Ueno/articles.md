### 🚉 Ueno Station Survival Guide
**Tags**: #Luggage #Transfer #CrowdAvoidance

- **Avoid the Main Transfer Gate**: The transfer between Ginza Line and Hibiya Line is extremely crowded. If you have large luggage, do NOT use the direct underground connector; it has narrow stairs. Instead, go up to street level (Exit 1) and cross the street.
- **Elevator Secret**: The only elevator to the Ginza Line platform is hidden behind the ticket gates near the "Panda Bridge" exit. It's unmarked on many older maps.
- **Budget Tip**: If going to Narita, walking 5 mins to Keisei Ueno Station saves you money compared to taking the JR Express from the main Ueno station.
